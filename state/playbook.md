## Heuristics
- Prefer line-bundle / invertible-sheaf RR statements; divisor RR is a wrapper.
- Use `finrank k` for dimensions; avoid `Nat`-based dims until the end.
- Keep lemma statements small: fewer binders, fewer coercions, fewer implicit arguments.
- When stuck on coercions, introduce explicit `let` bindings for objects (e.g. `L : LineBundle X`).

## Status
- RESOLVED (Cycle 2): Defined `RRData` structure bundling Div, deg, ell, genus, K. RR statement elaborates.
- RESOLVED (Cycle 3): Extended to `RRDataWithCohomology` and `RRDataWithEuler`.
- **DERIVED** (not proved): `RRDataWithEuler.riemannRoch` is derived from assumed structure fields.
- **RESOLVED (Cycle 4)**: Foundation building - Divisor type and degree
  - `Divisor α := α →₀ ℤ` (abbrev for transparent unification)
  - `deg : Divisor α → ℤ` (sum of coefficients)
  - **PROVED**: `deg_add`, `deg_zero`, `deg_neg`, `deg_sub`, `deg_single`

## Blockers (fundamental)
- mathlib lacks: line bundles, sheaf cohomology H⁰/H¹, genus for schemes
- Cannot yet instantiate `RRData.Div` with real `Divisor α` (needs point type from curve)
- `RRData.deg` is abstract; not yet connected to `Divisor.deg`

## Next Steps (Cycle 5)
- Connect `Divisor.deg` to `RRData.deg`
- Define effective divisor: `D.Effective := ∀ p, 0 ≤ D p`
- Explore: Can we define `ell` in terms of sections? (May need sheaf structure)
- Alternative: Define `ℓ(D)` as cardinality of some set related to D
